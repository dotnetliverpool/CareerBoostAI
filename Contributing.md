## Testing
- **Unit tests** must be written for all **domain and application project logic**.
- Run tests before submitting a pull request:
  ```bash
  dotnet test
  ```

## How to Contribute

### Branching Strategy
- **Main Branch (`main`)**: Stable production-ready code.
- **Development Branch (`develop`)**: Base branch for all new work.
- **Feature Branches (`feature/your-feature-name`)**: For new features.
- **Bug Fix Branches (`bugfix/your-bug-name`)**: For bug fixes.

**Example workflow:**
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes and commit
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep PRs focused and avoid bundling multiple changes.
- Ensure your code follows the [Style Guide](#code-style-guide).
- Reference related issues using `Closes #issue_number`.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting.
- Request a review from a maintainer.

## How to Report a Bug
- Go to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/dotnetliverpool/CareerBoostAI/issues).
- Check if the issue already exists.

## First Bugs for Contributors
