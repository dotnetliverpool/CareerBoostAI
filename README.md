## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles, with a **Domain-Driven Design** approach and utilizes **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for efficient handling of commands and queries. The codebase is structured as follows:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CareerBoostAI.Api/           # API endpoints and configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CareerBoostAI.Application/   # Application business logic and use cases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CareerBoostAI.Domain/        # Domain entities and business rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CareerBoostAI.Infrastructure/ # External services, Optimised Domain Reporting (Queries) and data access
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CareerBoostAI.Contracts/     # Shared DTOs and interfaces
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CareerBoostAI.Shared.Abstractions/  # Shared abstractions and interfaces
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **.NET 8**: Core framework
- **Entity Framework Core**: Data access and ORM
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute
- **MySQL Database**: Data storage
- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: AI/ML Integration
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation
